This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Welcome

This is a web app that contains several small web apps to showcase different tools, libraries and my ability to code.

---

I deployed this project on Vercel. 

Here is the link:

https://the-project-ashen.vercel.app/

The project gets automatically updated. Everytime something is pushed to main,
the site linked above will contain the updated web app. The setup on Vercel
will run a production deployment whenever something is pushed to main.

### Interesting Libraries used:
- Tailwind
- React
- Next.js
- multiple small utility libraries
    - uuid, DOMPurify, Animate-Height, clx
 
#### Todo App
- TipTap (RichText Editor Library)
- HeadlessUI

### Next Steps
I want to use a Database to persist the state of my apps.

Todo App:
- add drag and drop functionality using dnd-kit

TicTacToe:
- persist the score and add a global score reset
