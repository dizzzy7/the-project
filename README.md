This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Welcome

This is a web app that contains several small web apps to showcase different tools, libraries and my ability to code.

I deployed this project on Vercel. 

Here is the link:

Pushing to main will trigger a so called "production deployment",
updating this project that is linked above.

### Interesting Libraries used:
#### TicTacToe
- Pure React
 
#### Todo App
- React
- TipTap (RichText Editor Library)
- HeadlessUI

### Next Steps
I want to use a Database to persist the state of my apps.

Todo App:
- add drag and drop functionality using dnd-kit

TicTacToe:
- persist the score and add a global score reset
